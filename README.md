No Spoilers! is the tool you need in the modern world of non-stop streaming to avoid having your favourite TV shows ruined by either friends or the Internet. 
* Allows the user to track the shows they are watching.
* Provides links to a variety of websites (IMDB, Wikipedia etc) as they looked at the time the last episode that they watched aired. 
* Provides a forum for fans to discuss the show, filtered so that the user can only see conversations occurring about episodes they have seen.
* Provides live chat functionality to link users up with other fans who have seen the same number of episodes as them.
